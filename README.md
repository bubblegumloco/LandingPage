# Landing Page

A basic landing page for a non-existent radiation safety company. This project was created to practice using HTML and CSS Flexbox. It is the second
project in TOP.

In the future, I hope to add relevant links to explain the mechanism, how it is present in nature, and general safety tips used for preventative measures. 


# What I Learned 
  * Utilizing Flexbox to create an efficient layout system 
  * Understood the difference between justify-content and align-items and how they change based on flex-direction 
  * Box Shadow property in CSS to lower the intensity of the images
